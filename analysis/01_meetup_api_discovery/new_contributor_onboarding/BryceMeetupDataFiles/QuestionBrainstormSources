Big Question: Who is participating in meetups?

Source 1: What Meetups Tell Us About America
  - URL: https://priceonomics.com/what-meetups-tell-us-about-america/
  - Summary:
      - Using data from 2002 to 2015, meetups can be used to show what the city and interests of the city are like
      - Can be used to show current tech hubs and emerging ones
  - Analysis:
      - the source presents a lot of data tables and use them to defend their statements
      - the datatables use a different type of comparison in each table, so getting a feel for trends is difficult in some instances
      - seems reliable and that the author knows the data they are talking about at least, but doesn't sound as if the author takes place in a lot of meetups
      - interesting because it shows that some cities floolow their stereotypes, while others are trying to break away from theirs

Source 2: Map: Emerging tech hubs and what they're specializing in
  - URL: https://www.marketplace.org/2017/05/24/tech/next-big-tech-hub/steve-case-rise-rest-technology-focus
  - Summary:
      - Small tech hubs are beginning to pop up with a specialization in one particular industry of tech
  - Analysis:
      - the source uses a mpa to show different tech hubs that have popped up, but gives little to no support of what they claim for some
      - interesting because these new hubs could be future hotspots in the industry
      
Source 3: This One Does Not Go Up to 11: The Quantified Self Movement as an Alternative Big Data Practice
  - URL: http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/2170/1157
  - Summary:
    - Discusses the Quantified Self Movement and the effects of its "Soft Resistance" to the traditional thinking pattern in Big Data
        - QSM tracks certain statistics about a person over a long period of tiem, in hopes of identifying both good and bad trends
  - Analysis
    - while a lot of the data won't be used, the ideas behind it are really interesting
    - the idea of "sub-groups" within a specific type of meetup is very important I think because the bigger meetup types can be broken down into smaller pieces
    
 Research Questions:
  1. Where are emerging/smaller tech-hubs beginning to pop up?
  2. Do the meetups in one area focus around a specialty or are they more general or all over the place?
  3. What new "subtopics" are beginning to show up?
  
 Question I would like to explore further:
    - Where are emerging or smaller tech-hubs beginning to pop up?
